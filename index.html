            <p>I'm a 31-year-old male, and here is a short summary of myself and my future goals.

                Over the years, I have always strived to do my best at any company and have never given up on my own future or the future of the company. 
                I have always believed in working as if I own the business, and this mindset has never faded. 
                I have always made myself available for additional work and have dedicated myself to learning as much as I can to improve myself and help others who may need it. 
                I do not shy away from work pressure or long hours. While I may face challenges like anyone else, I am always willing to take them on with enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p> I wanted to share with you my future plans, specifically my newfound passion for coding.

                In the past, I have always struggled to find my dream job, but recently, I was introduced to coding, and it has completely changed my perspective. 
                This new interest has captivated my attention like nothing else before, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. 
                Learning to code has not only been a rewarding experience but has also given me the freedom to create.
                
                Currently, I am fully committed to this learning journey, as I believe it is crucial for me to become a confident coder. 
                I am confident that with time and dedication, I will achieve my goal. By the time you read this, I am positive that I have already become that confident coder.
                
                My ultimate vision and goal are to pursue coding as a long-term career path. 
                I want to dedicate as much time as I am capable of working, and eventually retire as an old man, knowing that I spent my life doing something I truly enjoyed.
                
                Thank you for taking the time to read about my plans. I am excited about what the future holds and determined to make the most
            </p>
